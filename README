`wheezy.routing`_ is a `python`_ package written in pure Python
code. It is a simple mapping between URL patterns (as plain
simple strings, curly expressions or regular expressions) to
a handler that can be anything you like (there is no limitation
or prescription what handler is or could be).

The mapping can include other mappings and constructed dynamically.

It is optimized for performance, well tested and documented.

* `documentation`_, `readthedocs`_
* `eggs`_ on `pypi`_
