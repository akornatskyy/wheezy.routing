Wheezy Routing
==============

Introduction
------------

:ref:`wheezy.routing` is a `python`_ package written in pure Python code 
with no dependencies to other python packages. It is a simple 
extensible mapping between URL patterns (as plain simple strings, curly 
expressions or regular expressions) to a handler that can be anything 
you like (there is no limitation or prescription what handler is 
or should be).

The mapping can include other mappings and constructed dynamically.
It is optimized for performance, well tested and documented.
